# EnviroPlusWeb
Web interface for Enviro+ sensor board plugged into a Raspberry PI

A very simple Flask application that serves a wep page with the current sensor readings and a graph over a specified time period.

If you have a particle sensor, change "Part_sensor = 0" to "Part_sensor = 1" in app.py.
